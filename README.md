# Data Science Internship Sonepar
This project consists of predicting demand quantity in supply chain, for the next few months based on the demand history in the past 3 years. 
To do this, I have used different prediction models and have compared their accuray.

Step 1: Data preparation
- Adjust the types of features
- Complete missing values
- Complete missing dates
- Feature engineering
- Outliers treatement

Step 2: Exploratory data analysis
- Calculate the mean, maximum and minimum of each of the numeric variables
- Understand the hierarchy of some features
- Claculate the correlation values between some numerical features
- Plot a KDE ( Kernel Density Estimate) plot of some features
- Seasonality check

Step 3: Train and evaluate the models
- Reshape data in the adequate form
- Train and evaluate the model
- Tune the hyperparameters

Step 4: Compare the different models performance
- Compare RMSE/WMAPE values of the different models
